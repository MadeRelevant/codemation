This also fixes AI agent tool schema serialization, nested tool item propagation, and execution inspector/canvas status handling for inline scheduler workflows.

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/pull/35) [`75b885b`](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/commit/75b885b111cc34ffe3a192ca9cc8cd3864fdf8ff) Thanks [@cblokland90](https://github.com/cblokland90)! - Replace the local-development `pglite` path with SQLite across the host, CLI, scaffolding templates, and packaged dev flows while keeping PostgreSQL for production-aligned and shared integration scenarios.

  Split Prisma into provider-specific PostgreSQL and SQLite schema and migration tracks so generated clients and startup migrations select the correct backend without the old `pglite` socket adapter.

- [#35](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/pull/35) [`75b885b`](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/commit/75b885b111cc34ffe3a192ca9cc8cd3864fdf8ff) Thanks [@cblokland90](https://github.com/cblokland90)! - Move browser auth/session ownership into `@codemation/host` and make `@codemation/next-host` a thin UI client over the backend `/api/auth/*` surface.

  Update packaged dev/scaffolded flows so the CLI provides the public base URL and auth secret wiring needed for the new backend-owned session flow, and refresh the templates/docs to match the clean cutover away from the legacy NextAuth runtime.

## 0.0.19

### Patch Changes

- [#26](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/pull/26) [`405c854`](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/commit/405c8541961f41dcba653f352691a821b0470ca0) Thanks [@cblokland90](https://github.com/cblokland90)! - Fix manual trigger reruns and current-state resume behavior.

  Current-state execution now treats empty upstream outputs like the live queue planner, so untaken branches stay dead on resume. Manual downstream runs can also synthesize trigger test items through core intent handling instead of relying on host-specific trigger logic.
