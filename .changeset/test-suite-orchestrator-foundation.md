Foundation for first-class **workflow testing**: a TestTrigger node, an IsTestRun branching node, an Assertion node, a `TestSuiteOrchestrator` service that fans one workflow run per yielded fixture item, host-side persistence (Prisma `TestSuiteRun` + `TestAssertion` tables, repositories, `TestRunnerService`), and a per-suite event tracker that records assertions and node coverage. HTTP routes and the canvas Tests tab (next-host) ship in follow-up slices.

**What this slice adds**

- **`@codemation/core` — additive contract changes**
  - `RunExecutionOptions.testContext?: { testSuiteRunId; testCaseIndex }` — set by the orchestrator on each test-case run; threaded through `ExecutionContext` so nodes can read it as `ctx.testContext`. Propagates to subworkflow runs via `ParentExecutionRef.testContext` + `EngineExecutionLimitsPolicy.mergeExecutionOptionsForNewRun`, so assertions emitted by subworkflows land under the correct parent test case.
  - `TriggerNodeConfig.triggerKind?: "live" | "test"` — `"test"` triggers are skipped by `TriggerRuntimeService` (live activation, webhooks, polling) and are only invoked by the orchestrator.
  - `NodeConfigBase.emitsAssertions?: true` — marker the host-side `TestAssertionPersister` (next slice) keys off when subscribing to `nodeCompleted`.
  - New `AssertionResult` type (`pass | fail | error`, plus `score`, `expected`, `actual`, `message`, `details`) — the stable shape every assertion node emits on `main`.
  - New `TestTriggerNodeConfig` + `TestTriggerSetupContext` — author callback signature returns `AsyncIterable<Item>` and exposes credential resolution + an `AbortSignal`.
  - New `RunEvent` kinds: `testSuiteStarted`, `testCaseStarted`, `testCaseCompleted`, `testSuiteFinished` (with terminal status `succeeded | failed | partial | cancelled | errored`).
  - New `TestSuiteOrchestrator` service in `orchestration/` — drives the iterator, applies a per-suite concurrency semaphore (default 4), dispatches one `engine.runWorkflow(...)` per item with `executionOptions.testContext` set, awaits terminal status, and publishes lifecycle events on the existing `RunEventBus`. No persistence, no HTTP — pure engine logic so tests can drive it via in-memory deps.
  - `TestSuiteRunIdFactory`, `AbortControllerFactory` — DI-friendly minters used by the orchestrator.

- **`@codemation/core-nodes` — three new nodes**
  - **`TestTrigger`** / `TestTriggerNode`: drop on the canvas alongside live triggers. `setup` is a no-op; `execute` is a passthrough. The author's `generateItems` is consumed by the orchestrator.
  - **`IsTestRun`** / `IsTestRunNode`: per-item router with `true` / `false` ports. Routes to `true` iff `ctx.testContext` is set — lets workflows skip real side-effects in test runs (e.g. don't actually send the reply).
  - **`Assertion`** / `AssertionNode`: generic callback-style assertion node. Author returns `Promise<AssertionResult[]>` per item; the node emits one workflow `Item` per result. Sets `emitsAssertions: true` so the host persister can identify it.
  - Declarative shorthands (`StringEqualsAssertionNode`, `JudgeByAgentAssertionNode`) intentionally deferred — the generic callback node covers Phase 1 and the declarative variants compose on top.

- **`@codemation/host` — persistence + orchestration + HTTP**
  - **Prisma schema**: new `TestSuiteRun` and `TestAssertion` tables in both Postgres and SQLite mirrors. Adds `Run.testSuiteRunId` (FK with `ON DELETE SET NULL`) and `Run.testCaseIndex` (indexed for join + ordering). Workflow definition itself is **not** FK'd — workflows live in code; `TestSuiteRun.triggerNodeName` is snapshotted at creation so historical viewing survives node renames/deletions.
  - **`TestSuiteRunRepository`** + **`TestAssertionRepository`** domain interfaces with Prisma + in-memory adapters.
  - **`TestRunnerService`** (host application layer) — single facade for "start a test suite": creates the persistence row, drives the orchestrator, awaits, finalizes counts + coverage. Subscribes to `RunEventBus.subscribeToWorkflow` only for the lifetime of one suite (no global subscriber, no shared mutable state across concurrent suites).
  - **`TestSuiteRunTracker`** + **`TestSuiteRunTrackerFactory`** — per-suite event accumulator. Two-stage event buffering tolerates inline runners that emit `nodeCompleted` synchronously inside `runWorkflow` (before the orchestrator publishes `testCaseStarted`); without it, fast/in-memory engines drop assertions silently.
  - **`AssertionResultGuard`** — type-guard the tracker uses to skip junk output if a misconfigured `emitsAssertions: true` node emits non-assertion items (defensive, not crash-on-bad-input).
  - **HTTP routes** (Hono, all behind the existing session-verifier middleware):
    - `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/test-suite-runs` body `{ triggerNodeId, concurrency? }` → 201 with `{ testSuiteRunId, status, totalCases, passedCases, failedCases }`
    - `GET /api/workflows/:workflowId/test-suite-runs` → list summaries
    - `GET /api/test-suite-runs/:id` → detail (including `concurrency`, `nodeCoverage`, `errorMessage`)
    - `GET /api/test-suite-runs/:id/assertions` → all assertions across the suite's child runs
    - `GET /api/runs/:runId/assertions` → assertions for one child run
    - Paths exposed through `ApiPaths.workflowTestSuiteRuns/testSuiteRun/testSuiteRunAssertions/runAssertions` so the next-host React Query layer can call them by helper instead of string literals.
  - **DI bootstrap** in `AppContainerFactory`: registers all new singletons (factories, mappers, guard, repository selector, route handler + registrar) and wires Prisma vs in-memory `TestSuiteRunRepository` / `TestAssertionRepository` based on `appConfig.persistence.kind` (mirroring the existing `WorkflowRunRepository` selection). `TestSuiteOrchestrator` itself is registered via a tsyringe factory that injects `Engine` + the engine-side `RunEventBus` + a fresh `CredentialResolverFactory(CredentialSessionService)`.
  - **DTOs** in `application/contracts/TestingContracts.ts`: `StartTestSuiteRunRequest/Response`, `TestSuiteRunSummaryDto`, `TestSuiteRunDetailDto`, `TestAssertionDto`. Mappers (`TestSuiteRunSummaryMapper`, `TestAssertionMapper`) translate persistence records → wire shape.
  - **WebSocket / event narrowing** — `WorkflowWebsocketServer` and one integration test reader updated to type-narrow on the new test-suite event kinds (which carry `testSuiteRunId` rather than `runId`).

**Tests**

- `TestSuiteOrchestrator` unit suite (6 tests): per-item dispatch with `testContext`, partial-pass aggregation, lifecycle event emission, concurrency cap, `errored` status when `generateItems` throws, rejection of non-test triggers.
- Node unit suite (6 tests): TestTrigger passthrough + `triggerKind === "test"`, IsTestRun routing on both branches, AssertionNode emitting one item per result, `emitsAssertions === true`.
- `TestRunnerService` integration suite (2 tests): creates the persistence row, finalizes counts + coverage, persists 3 `TestAssertion` rows from a 2-case suite (one passing, one failing); rejects non-test triggers without leaving a phantom row.

- **`@codemation/next-host` — Tests tab UI**
  - **Third canvas tab** ("Tests") next to Live workflow / Executions, mutually exclusive with both. Local React state for now (Phase 1) — promotion to the URL codec is a Phase 2 cleanup once the UX is settled.
  - **`TestsPanel`** — top-level container with a trigger picker (shadcn `Select` populated from workflow nodes whose `triggerKind === "test"`), a "Run tests" CTA wired through `useStartTestSuiteRunMutation`, a left list of past suite runs, and a right detail panel.
  - **`TestSuitePassRateChart`** — recharts line chart of pass rate over time across this workflow's suite runs. Carries an explicit `rolling-input` label so authors don't read trends as agent regressions when the underlying fixtures drift (Phase 2 ships snapshots).
  - **`TestSuiteRunsList`** + **`TestSuiteRunStatusBadge`** — list rows + colored status badges (`running` / `succeeded` / `partial` / `failed` / `cancelled` / `errored`).
  - **`TestSuiteRunDetailPanel`** — header with pass-rate + counts + concurrency + nodes-covered + (when set) an `errorMessage` callout; the body is a per-run grouped assertions list.
  - **`TestAssertionsList`** + **`TestAssertionRow`** — each assertion shows status badge, optional score, optional `expected`/`actual` JSON viewers side-by-side.
  - **React Query hooks** (`testSuiteHooks.ts`) cover all four GET endpoints plus the start mutation, with cache invalidation on `workflowTestSuiteRunsQueryKey` after a successful run.
  - **WorkflowNodeDto** + **mapper additions** (host + next-host's `PersistedWorkflowSnapshotMapper`) propagate `triggerKind` to the wire shape so the Tests panel can identify test triggers without server round-trips. Both mappers default omitted values to `"live"` to keep the wire DTO consistent.

**Not in this slice (planned follow-ups)**

- Test-input snapshots (Phase 2 — Phase 1 inputs are always live; UI carries a "rolling-input" label so charts aren't read as agent regressions).
- Declarative assertion family (StringEquals, JsonPath, JudgeByAgent helpers — generic callback `Assertion` covers Phase 1).
- Cancellation endpoint (`POST /api/test-suite-runs/:id/cancel`) — orchestrator already supports `AbortSignal` cancellation; the HTTP surface for it is deferred until the UI surfaces it.
- Realtime updates on the Tests panel — currently the suite list refetches on mutation success; live `testSuite*` events arrive via the existing realtime bridge but the Tests panel doesn't subscribe yet.
- URL codec entry for `pane=tests` so suite drilldowns are deep-linkable (currently in-memory React state).
- Coverage heatmap overlay on the canvas itself.

The contract additions are **strictly additive**; no existing API surface changed shape.
