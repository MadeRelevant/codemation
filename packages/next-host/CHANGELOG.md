This also fixes AI agent tool schema serialization, nested tool item propagation, and execution inspector/canvas status handling for inline scheduler workflows.

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/pull/35) [`75b885b`](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/commit/75b885b111cc34ffe3a192ca9cc8cd3864fdf8ff) Thanks [@cblokland90](https://github.com/cblokland90)! - Move browser auth/session ownership into `@codemation/host` and make `@codemation/next-host` a thin UI client over the backend `/api/auth/*` surface.

  Update packaged dev/scaffolded flows so the CLI provides the public base URL and auth secret wiring needed for the new backend-owned session flow, and refresh the templates/docs to match the clean cutover away from the legacy NextAuth runtime.

### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/pull/35) [`75b885b`](https://github.com/MadeRelevant/codemation/commit/75b885b111cc34ffe3a192ca9cc8cd3864fdf8ff) Thanks [@cblokland90](https://github.com/cblokland90)! - Align dev auth with the runtime API: proxy `/api/auth/*` through `CODEMATION_RUNTIME_DEV_URL` so SQLite has a single DB owner, tighten middleware path rules to avoid redundant session checks, and document root `pnpm dev` framework-author flow.

  Split Prisma into provider-specific PostgreSQL and SQLite schema and migration tracks so generated clients and startup migrations select the correct backend without the old `pglite` socket adapter.

  Keep the release loop exercised after tightening `main` to PR-only merges and after adding scaffolded browser coverage for auth-session startup.

  Clarify the trigger item contract so integrations emit one workflow item per external event instead of wrapper payloads.
